## About
Our site will visualize the relationship between data concerning school scores (GPA and SAT) and substance abuse by state. The visualization will be split into two portions, one describing the United States as a whole, and another for each individual state. A heat map of the United States will be used to demonstrate how closely substance abuse correlates with school scores depending on state. A user may interact with this heat map by clicking on a state in order to get more information. This portion will display various statistics regarding substance abuse of choice, substance abuse based on age groups or family income, school scores overall, as well as how closely correlated these two data sets are.
